\begin{enumerate}
\item Probabilistic models augment normal state machines by associating probabilities with transitions. List one advantage of having models with this additional level of expressiveness. List one disadvantage.

\item Consider the following probabilistic model, that emulates a 6-sided die with a fair coin. Starting from state 0 ({\tt s=0}), a coin is tossed at every step, and there is a 50\% chance of taking each of the two possible choices. The process finishes when you reach one of the values of the die on the right-hand side (encoded in variable {\tt d} in the PRISM listing):

For each of the following questions/statements: (a) write a PCTL temporal formula to obtain the answer, (b) write the result obtained by checking the PCTL formula with the PRISM tool, and (c) briefly explain why that result was obtained.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the probability of rolling a 6? \\
  \begin{center}
    P=? [ F d=6 ] \\
    Result: \\
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{p6}\\
    0.16 makes sense as the probability of rolling any side of a die is $\frac{1}{6}$ 
  \end{center}
\item Are the probability of rolling a 1 and a 4 the same?
\item With probability 1, the value of the die will be 0 until state 7 is reached.
\item What is the probability of eventually reaching state 3?
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{p2d}\\
  \end{center}
\item What is the probability of eventually reaching state 3 and rolling a 2?
\item What is the probability of eventually reaching state 3 and rolling a 5?

\end{enumerate}

\item Consider the client-server example seen in class. For each of the following questions/statements: (a) write a PCTL temporal formula to obtain the answer, (b) write the result obtained by checking the PCTL formula with the PRISM tool, and (c) briefly explain why that result was obtained.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the probability that the client will acquire the channel in the first attempt, and that the server will fail to reply?
\item  The server will never attempt to reply (successfully or unsuccessfully) until a request has successfully been sent by the client.
\end{enumerate}
