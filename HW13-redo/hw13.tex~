\homework{\hspace*{1.15in}Homework \#13}{26 November 2018}{Petri Nets 1}{}



\begin{enumerate}

\item Consider a small garden, similar to the one described by Kramer and Magee, that has two entrances, an East entrance and a West entrance. Users may enter or leave either entrance through a small gate that permits only one user to enter or leave at a time. The park can hold up to 10 people. Model this system using a Petri Net. \\

\item Consider a traffic light that controls traffic on a two-lane road. The light is normally green, allowing cars to pass through. But when a user presses a button, the traffic light should turn yellow, and then red, allowing some number of users to cross the street. It then turns green again, and users are prohibited from crossing.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Describe this system using a Petri Net.
    \item Does your net guarantee that the light cannot turn red without first turning yellow? Justify briefly.
    \item Does your net guarantee that an arriving car will eventually be allowed to pass through the light?
    \item List three aspects of the real system that are abstracted away by your model.
    \end{enumerate}


\item For the P/V Petri Net shown in Figure 15 of Peterson's article
(Pet77.pdf, page 234):

\begin{enumerate}
 \item  Construct the reachability tree, using the tree condensation
        algorithm shown in class. Assume that the ordering of places in the state vector of the Petri Net shown in Figure 15 is:
(P1, P2, P3, P4, S).


 \item Use this to argue that the design is correct, i.e., that it is
       not possible for the system to be simultaneously in the
       critical sections of both processes.
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
