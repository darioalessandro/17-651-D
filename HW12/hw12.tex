This trace is read as follows: ``in state 1 $p$ is true and $q$ is false, in state 2 $p$ is true and $q$ is false, and so on for the entire trace." $\Box (p \lor q)$ is true for the given trace since $p$ is true in every state of the trace (and hence so is $p \lor q$), but $\Box (p \land q)$ is not true since that would require both $p$ and $q$ to be true in every state of the trace.\begin{enumerate}\item \makebox[1.5in][l]{$\Diamond p\land\Diamond q$}   $\Diamond(p\land\Diamond q)\lor\Diamond(q\land\Diamond p)$\item \makebox[1.5in][l]{$\Diamond p\land\Diamond q$}  $\Diamond(p\land q)$\item \makebox[1.5in][l]{$\Box(p\lor q)$} $\Box p \lor \Box q$\item \makebox[1.5in][l]{$(p\land q)\Until r$} $(p\Until r)\land (q\Until r)$\end{enumerate}\item Assuming that the following are true of $\sigma$:\begin{itemize}\item $\Box((p\implies q)\lor s)$\item $(\sigma,3)\models\Box p $\item $(\sigma,3)\models\Next(q\land\Next\Box r) $\item $(\sigma,4)\models\Box(r\implies\neg q) $\end{itemize}which of the following are true, which are false, and which could be either?\begin{enumerate}\item $(\sigma,5)\models q$\item $(\sigma,4)\models s$\item $(\sigma,5)\models s$\item $(\sigma,3)\models q\lor s$\item $(\sigma,4)\models r$\end{enumerate}\item The following is an FSP model of the alternating-bit communication protocolover an unreliable link:\begin{small}\begin{verbatim}const Max = 1 range Msg = 0..MaxSENDER = SENDER[0], SENDER[i:Msg] = (    send_msg[i] -> (        msg_received[i] -> (            // proceed to send the next message            ack_received[i] -> SENDER[(i + 1) % (Max + 1)]            |            // retransmit            ack_timeout[i] -> SENDER[i]        )        |        // retransmit        msg_timeout[i] -> SENDER[i]    )).RECEIVER = RECEIVER[0][1], RECEIVER[i:Msg][j:Msg] = (    msg_received[i] -> send_ack[i] -> ( // process the currently expected message        ack_received[i] -> RECEIVER[(i + 1) % (Max + 1)][i]        |        ack_timeout[i] -> RECEIVER[(i + 1) % (Max + 1)][i]    )    |    msg_received[j] -> send_ack[j] -> ( // process the previously expected message        ack_received[j] -> RECEIVER[(j + 1) % (Max + 1)][j]        |        ack_timeout[j] -> RECEIVER[(j + 1) % (Max + 1)][j]    )).||ALTBITPROTOCOL = (SENDER || RECEIVER).\end{verbatim}\end{small}As shown by the model, this protocol follows the ``stop-and-wait''style. That is, a new message is not transmitted from the sender tothe receiver unless (1)~the receiver has sent back an acknowledgmentand (2)~the sender has received that acknowledgement. Since, thelink is unreliable, both messages and acknowledgments may be lost atany time. Also, notice that the link is ``half-duplex''---meaningthat transmissions go over one direction at a time.\begin{enumerate}\item Use LTSA to check if this protocol is deadlock free. Briefly explain why the protocol is deadlock free or why it is not. \\\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{deadlocks.png}\item Define fluents \verb"MSG_SENT" and \verb"ACK_SENT" and an FLTLformula which uses those fluents and states that every messagetransmitted by the sender is eventually retrieved by the receiver.\item Use LTSA to check if the protocol satisfies your LTL property. Briefly explain why the property is satisfied or why it is not.\item Modify the model by removing the \verb"*_timeout" transitionchoices and rerun LTSA to check if the modified protocol is deadlockfree. Briefly explain why the modified protocol is deadlock free or why it is not.\end{enumerate}NOTE: For every question in which you are asked to use the LTSA LTLproperty checker, you need to include the actual resulting output ofthe checker.\end{enumerate}\end{document}
