\homework{}{05 November 2018}{Homework \#10: Concurrency}{}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Traces and Specifications:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Enumerate the traces for the following process \verb"P":
\begin{verbatim}
 P = (a -> a -> END | b -> a -> END).
\end{verbatim}
$traces == $
$ \{ \langle a, a \rangle, \langle b, a \rangle, \langle a \rangle, \langle b \rangle \} $ \\

\item Enumerate the traces for the following process \verb"P":
\begin{verbatim}
 P1 = (a -> a -> END).
 P2 = (a -> b -> END | a -> c -> END).
 ||P = (P1 || P2).
\end{verbatim}
$traces ==  \{ \langle a, b \rangle, \langle a,c \rangle \} $ \\
\\
It is important to mention that P1 seems to always deadlock as it requires 2 $a$ actions to reach the $END$ but P2 can only go through 1 a per run. \\
\end{enumerate}

\item More Concurrency:

Consider the two processes \texttt{STUDENT} and \texttt{TEACHER}, where
\begin{align*}
    \alpha\ \mathtt{STUDENT} &= \{\mathtt{do\_hw}, \mathtt{hand\_in}, \mathtt{pass}, \mathtt{fail}, \mathtt{cheer}, \mathtt{curse}\} \\
    \alpha\ \mathtt{TEACHER} &= \{\mathtt{hand\_in}, \mathtt{grade}, \mathtt{pass}, \mathtt{fail}, \mathtt{grumble}\}
\end{align*}
The student repeatedly does her homework, hands it in, and gets a pass or fail---cheering when she
passes and cursing when she fails. The teacher repeatedly collects the homework, grades it, and then assigns a pass or
fail grade---grumbling after any time that he has to give out a failing grade.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write an FSP process that characterizes the student and show a diagram that indicates its
  behavior. \\
\begin{verbatim}
STUDENT = (do_hw -> hand_in -> STUDENT_SEND),

STUDENT_SEND = (pass -> cheer -> STUDENT | fail -> curse -> STUDENT).  
\end{verbatim}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3in]{STUDENT.png}
\end{center}

\item Write an FSP process that characterizes the teacher and show a diagram that indicates its
  behavior. \\

\begin{verbatim}
TEACHER = (hand_in->grade->TEACHER_GRADE_RESULT),

TEACHER_GRADE_RESULT = (pass -> TEACHER | fail -> grumble -> TEACHER).
\end{verbatim}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3in]{TEACHER.png}
\end{center}  

\item Produce an LTS graph for \texttt{STUDENT || TEACHER}.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5in]{TEACHER_STUDENT.png}
\end{center}

  
\item What happens to this process if we augment \texttt{STUDENT}'s alphabet with the \texttt{grumble} event and
have her grumble before doing her homework? Why does this occur? \\

$TEACHER\_STUDENT$ will deadlock because STUDENT will get stuck in grumble waiting for TEACHER to grumble, but TEACHER will get stuck waiting for the student to hand in the homework.

\end{center}
LTSA presents a nice warning message when executing the composition:

\end{center}

\item If your answer to the previous question involves deadlock, list
two ways that you might change the definition to avoid this
unintended problem. ({\sc Note}: You may not change the order in which events happen. For example, do not move the student's \texttt{grumble} event after her \texttt{hand\_in} event. Preserve the intended behavior of the model.)
\end{enumerate} 
1. Rename STUDENT grumble to $student_grumble$ so that it does not block the TEACHER state machine. \\
2. Renable TEACHER grumble to $teacher_grumble$ so that it does not block the STUDENT state machine. \\
This is an example of the graph renaming STUDENT grumble to $student_grumble$: \\

\item Exercises Based on MK06

Consider the model of the client--server system described in section~3.1.4 of MK06.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Extend the model of the client--server system so that more than one client can use the server. Your model should support an arbitrary number of clients (\texttt{N}). \\
\begin{verbatim}
CLIENT = (call->wait->continue->CLIENT).

SERVER = (request->service->reply->SERVER).

||CLIENTS(N=3) =(forall[i:1..N] s[i]:CLIENT).
    
||CLIENT_SERVER = (CLIENTS(2) || SERVER).
\end{verbatim}
Graph for CLIENTS N = 2 \\
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=6in]{CLIENT_SERVER_N2.png}
\end{center}
I could not figure out how to use labeling to synchronize the two state machines, MK06 does not cover how to do so when the processes are created through a set comprehension. \\
\item Modify your new model of the client--server system so that a client's call may terminate with a \texttt{timeout} action rather than a response from the server. (Do not modify the server process.) What condition results from this modification? \\
\\
My assumption is that if there's a timeout, the client will terminate as opposed to sending another request. \\
\\
The condition that results is a more realistic implementation of the client server model by incorporating a primitive error handling. \\
  
\begin{verbatim}
CLIENT = (call->ROBUST_CLIENT),

ROBUST_CLIENT = (wait->continue->CLIENT
                | timeout->ERROR).
\end{verbatim}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{CLIENT_WITH_ERROR_HANDLING.png}
\end{center}
Notice that there are some actions that are not possible, for example, that the server gets the request before the client sends it, I could not find a way to silence or remove those actions using the proper labeling to synchronize the two state machines. \\
