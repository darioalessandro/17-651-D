\noindent \textsc{Note}: For this assignment you must format your
answers using \LaTeX\ and typecheck your answer to question 3 using {\em fuzz},  Z-EVES, or the Community Z tools.

\begin{enumerate}

\item The following questions refer to the handout on the Library Problem.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write an operation to see if a book is currently checked out. \\
  Assuming that we need to find if a particular copy of a book is checked out and that
  we do not need to do handle the scenario when the book is not in the library.\\
  Using the definitions of $Library$, $BookOp$, $Copy$  provided in the Lecture: \\
  \\
  Defining type to answer: \\
  Answer ::= Yes $\mid$ No 
 \begin{schema}{IsBookCheckedOut}
   \Xi BookOp \\
   book?: Copy \\
   answer!: Answer
   \where
    book? \in books \\
    (\#{ b : books | (records\,b).status = out } = 1) \implies answer! = Yes \land
    records' = records) \land \\
    (\#{ b : books | (records\,b).status = out } = 0) \implies answer! = No \land
    records' = records) 
   
\end{schema}

 
 \item Suppose you are curious to find out whether other people are interested in the same books as you.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Is it possible to write an operation that returns the set of books that you have checked out and later returned, and that were checked out by someone else after you returned them? If so, write the operation. If not, say why. \\
      Given the definition of Data, which is the type used to store status and lastuser, \\
      it is not possible to preserve the history of the checkouts because every new user \\
      overwrites the $lastuser$ user field. \\
      We would have to modify our records data structure to create a new record every time a
      book is Checked in or out and if someone wanted to pull the history of a book, they would have to query all records for a given book, the last known record would be the current state. \\
    \item Is it possible to write an operation that returns the set of books that you have checked out and later returned, but that were NEVER checked out by someone else after you returned them? If so, write the operation. If not, say why. \\
      Given the previous answer, it is possible, here's the operation: \\
      \begin{schema}{AllTheBooksThatUserHasCheckedOutAndLaterReturned}
   \Xi BookOp \\
   person?: REAL\_PERSON \\
   user\_books!:\mathbb{F}Copy
   \where
   user\_books = { b : books | (records\,b).lastuser = person }
   \end{schema}
    \end{enumerate}
    
\end{enumerate}

\item The following questions refer to the handout on the Telephone Net.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Can a telephone Call itself? If so, what is the effect of a
subsequent Busy operation?

\item Write an explicit Connect operation to connect a pair of
phones. (HINT: Connect is different from Call; Connect establishes
a connection among phones on an outstanding satisfiable request. Note also that you can't use the Event framing schema here because it assumes that the starting state is an efficient net.)

\item Is it possible to place a call from a phone that's already
busy?

\item Give an example that illustrates a situation in which a
Hangup implies that a new connection will be made. Does the
specification say which connection will be made if more than one
is possible?

\item If a Hangup operation is applied to a ph? that is not yet
connected, what happens? Briefly speculate on how the
specification would have to be changed to make this more
realistic.

\item Modify Busy so that it also indicates which phones ph? is
connected to. What is the output if the input ph? is not connected
at all?

\end{enumerate}

\item The following scenario describes a typical classroom
situation.

\begin{enumerate} \item A teacher needs to keep track of
which homework assignments each student in the class has turned
in. Each student in the class is given an ID, and at any time each
student in the class has a (possibly empty) set of homeworks that
have been turned in. The system should only keep records of the
students in {\em this\/} class.

\begin{zed}
    [ID,STUDENTNAME,HOMEWORK]
\end{zed}
%%Unchecked
\begin{schema}{ClassRecords}
    student:ID \pfun STUDENTNAME \\
    turnedIn: STUDENTNAME \pfun \power HOMEWORK
\where
\t1 \\
\t1 \\
\t1
\end{schema}

Complete the schema with an appropriate invariant.

\textbf{Note:} You are not allowed to change the state variables
in the schema. Supply only an appropriate invariant.

%\vspace{12pt}

% Problem 2
\item Which of the following can be inferred from your definition
of $ClassRecords$? Briefly justify your answer.

\begin{itemize}
\item No two students are assigned the same $ID$.
%\vspace{.65in}

\item A given student may have more than one $ID$.
%\vspace{.65in}

\item There may be some $ID$s that are not used by the system.
%\vspace{.65in}

\item All students that have an $ID$ also have a set of
$HOMEWORK$s.
%\vspace{.65in}

\item Any student who has a set of $HOMEWORK$s also has an $ID$.
%\vspace{.65in}

\end{itemize}


% Problem 3
\item Write a schema $InitClassRecords$ that defines an
appropriate initial state space for the system. Explain why the
initial state space is consistent with the state space invariant
that you defined earlier.
%\vspace{2in}


% Problem 4
\item Write an operation to add a student to the class, provided
that the student is not already a member of the class.
%\vspace{2.5in}


% Problem 5
\item Write a robust version of the operation that returns an error
value if the student is already a member of the class. Use the schema
calculus: you should not need to rewrite the original operation.
%\vspace{3in}


% Problem 6
\item Write an operation, $DeadBeats$, that returns the set of $ID$s
(not student names!) of students who have not turned in more than one homework assignment.
%\vspace{2in}


% Problem 7
\item Consider the following globally-defined function that
determines whether a student's status is ok or not, based on a
comparison with the set of total assignments that could have been
turned in.

\begin{zed}
    STATUS ::= ok | not\_ok
\end{zed}

\begin{axdef}
    StatusOf: \power HOMEWORK \cross \power HOMEWORK \fun STATUS
\where
    \forall student, total: \power HOMEWORK @ \\
\t1    (StatusOf(student,total) = ok) \iff (\#(total \setminus
student) < 2)
\end{axdef}

Explain in informal terms when the status of a student is not ok.
